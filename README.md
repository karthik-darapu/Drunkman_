DrunkMan – Random Walk Simulation
This project simulates a "drunk man's walk" — a basic random walk on a 2D grid. At each step, the character randomly moves in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right.

Description
Starts from the origin (0, 0)

Takes a user-defined number of steps

Each step moves the character by 1 unit in a random direction

Displays the final position and distance from the origin

Files
drunkman.cpp – Main program file containing the simulation logic

How to Compile
Make sure you have a C++ compiler like g++.

bash
